    Factory Functions One of the main problems with object constructors is that they look like regular JS functions, however operate very differently
These functions are very similar to object constructors work, but instead of using the &ldquo;new&rdquo; keyword to create an object, they set up and return the object within the function
They do not use the prototype, so they aren&rsquo;t as efficient
const User = function (name) { this.name = name; this.
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/israel-palestine/">Israel Palestine</a></h2>
