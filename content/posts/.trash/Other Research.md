A Hash table is a data structure which organises data via **hash functions** in order to support quick insertion and search.

There are two different types of hash tables, hash set and hash map.

The hash set is an implementation of a set data structure to store no repeated values.
The hash map is one of the implementations of a map data structure to store (key, value) pairs.
